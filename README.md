## Program Overview

This repository contains a simple program that demonstrates the following:

1. Using `hello.cpp` for executing a simple "Hello World" program.
2. Using a recursive `factorial.cpp` program to calculate and print the factorial of a given number (5).

### hello.cpp

The `hello.cpp` file contains a basic C++ program that prints the message "Hello World!" to the console.

### factorial.cpp

The `factorial.cpp` file contains a recursive C++ program to calculate the factorial of a given number. The program calculates the factorial of the number of the number is positive, and prompts the user to reenter the number if it is negative.

#### Usage

1. Run the `make` command, which will run the necesaary commands to execute the file.
